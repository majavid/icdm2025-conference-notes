# 🌟 Day 1 Takeaways from AI4TS @ ICDM 2025 in Washington, DC! 🌟

I spent an incredibly stimulating day at the **AI for Time Series Analysis: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications (AI4TS)** workshop ([link](https://ai4ts.github.io/icdm2025)), diving deep into the cutting edge of **time series (TS)** modeling.

A central theme that resonated with me across several talks was the growing, yet still evolving, role of **causality** in TS analysis.

## Key Highlights & Insights

### 1️⃣ “Four Pillars for PTS Analysis” & “TSFMs for Perception” – Agnes F. Liu (University of Maryland)

A good and concise summary of the **state-of-the-art in TS models**, offering a fresh perspective on integrating these models for complex systems.  
The concept of **Temporal Foundation Models (TSFMs)** as the pillar for *Perception* (as shown in the slides) is a nice one and gives a modular view of TS pipelines.

### 2️⃣ “TS-CausalNN: Learning Temporal Causal Relations from Non-linear Non-stationary Time Series Data” – Omar Faruque (University of Maryland)

This talk sat right at the intersection of:
- **Causal discovery**
- **Time series**
- **Continuous optimization**

Very much in the spirit of **NOTEARS (Zheng et al., 2018)** but tailored to temporal structure. This is exactly the kind of direction that connects my own interests in causal modeling and TS.

### 3️⃣ Keynotes by Dr. Panagiotis Papapetrou (Stockholm University) & Dr. Rex Ying (Yale University)

- **Dr. Papapetrou** touched on **counterfactuals in time series**, but interestingly, causality itself mostly appeared as “future work,” even though counterfactuals are inherently causal concepts by nature.

- **Dr. Ying** discussed **benchmarking TS models**, including issues like poor alignment due to missing causal links. From my **Pearl-style causality** lens, the way causality entered these benchmarks still feels *non-causal*—or at least not yet explicitly framed in that language.

---

## Overall Impression

There are **huge opportunities at the intersection of time series modeling and causal reasoning**, both in terms of:
- **Theory** (causal structure in temporal models, counterfactuals for TS), and  
- **Practice** (benchmarks, evaluation, robustness across domains).

Stay tuned for more updates from ICDM 2025!
